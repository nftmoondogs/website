  In our Woof Space Twitter spaces, which we host on our Twitter, we regularly welcome 30+ Founders of the most eagerly awaited new NFT projects. As a result, they have a platform where they can gain organic exposure for their project, and in exchange, they add value to our holders by offering a large number of their WL spots to our community.
